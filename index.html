<p>As little kid I played lots of sports to see which ones I liked. I played football, soccer, basketball,<br>rugby, tennis, and swimming.</p>
  <ol style=color:red;>
    <li>I played tackle football for two years when I was 5 and 6 years old and I liked it a lot but the program ended.</li>
    <li>I played soccer from when I was 5-9 years old and had fun with it but stopped playing because I moved and didn't feel like joining something different.</li>
    <li>I played basketball for around 2 years and it was fun but didn't have the size.</li>
    <li>For Rugby, I started playing when I was like 5 years old and I really liked it, I played it even after I movedto Weston on a different team. Then when I moved back to Miami 2 years ago I rejoined my old team in Key Biscayne </li>
    <li>I think I did swimming when I was like 7 but I was always pretty slow at it, I only did it for one year.</li>
    <li>I started playing tennis when I was 3 or 4 years old, my dad was a tennis coach so he started me early and I still play to this day.</li>
  </ol>

  <p id="Sports">
My favorite sport to watch is by far football for me. I really like the sport and supporting my team(Miami Dolphins). My second favorite sport to watch would probably be soccer but mainly when Argentina play because for me it's so much more fun to watch the country that am from play. For third, I would go with either tennis or basketball, It really depends on what game is on with these two but if I had to choose, I would say basketball but I love watching tennis too.
